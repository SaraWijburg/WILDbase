More than 60% of all emerging infectious diseases are zoonotic and of those, more than 70% originate from wildlife [1]. Emerging wildlife diseases are a result of spillover events between wildlife and humans [2], and they seem to be becoming more frequent, often due to increased contact rates between humans and wild animals, in part driven by habitat loss and/or modification, increased urbanisation, changes in agricultural practices and the globalisation of trade and travel [3-5], as well as shifting ranges of wildlife and vectors due to climate change [6]. The health, economic and societal consequences of zoonotic spillover events from wildlife can be far-reaching, as exemplified by the recent COVID-19 pandemic [7-10].

Urban areas can be considered artificial ecosystems that provide ample opportunity for zoonotic pathogen spillover between wildlife, domestic animals and humans, and they can therefore form hotspots of increased zoonotic disease risk [11,12]. This is due to the close contact between humans and wildlife and the altered wildlife composition in urban areas compared with nature areas, which could result in new spillover events between wildlife species [2,5,13]. This in turn could lead to different pathogen transmission cycles and disease dynamics in urban areas and consequently to higher rates of exposure to zoonotic pathogens [14-16]. Moreover, changes to the urban environment that promote biodiversity, such as urban greening [17-20], could further alter disease dynamics in urban areas. These complex interactions underline the importance of broadening wildlife disease surveillance to multi-host and multi-pathogen communities to increase our understanding of pathogen transmission cycles in urban areas and to identify potential pathogen spillover between wildlife species. However, surveillance of wildlife diseases in urban areas can be challenging and most wildlife studies are performed outside of urban areas [21-23]. To facilitate wildlife surveillance in urban areas, having a comprehensive overview of zoonotic pathogens studied in urban wildlife species to determine how to set up this surveillance will help prioritise monitoring efforts.

While there are many studies investigating zoonotic pathogens in wildlife species, there is no common database where this information is systematically collected and stored. This study aimed to improve the surveillance and cross-country collaboration of wildlife-borne zoonoses, especially for, but not limited to, urban areas, by creating such a comprehensive and easily accessible database. To this end, we performed a systematic literature review of zoonotic pathogens studied in 10 common urban wildlife mammals. We present and summarise knowledge gaps in the monitoring of wildlife-borne zoonotic pathogens in Europe per pathogen, animal species, country, and habitat type. Further, we used the Netherlands as an example to demonstrate how this database can be used by other countries to identify their current knowledge gaps in wildlife disease surveillance. These knowledge gaps deserve more attention to identify potential pathogen spillover between species or the presence of multiple competent host species. The complete database underlying this study, named WILDbase, is publicly available at https://wildbase.org and in Supplement 1.
